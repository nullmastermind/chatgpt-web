The code you provided seems to be a function that preprocesses a message content by adding new lines to code blocks and removing unnecessary spaces. Here are some suggestions to improve, clean, and optimize the algorithm:

1. Use a regular expression to replace all occurrences of code blocks instead of splitting the content into an array and iterating over each line. This will make the code more concise and easier to read.

2. Use the `trim()` method to remove unnecessary spaces before and after each line. This will ensure that the code blocks are properly formatted.

3. Use the `replace()` method with a regular expression to replace all occurrences of multiple spaces with a single space. This will help to reduce the size of the message content.

Here's an updated version of the code that implements these suggestions:

```javascript
export const preprocessMessageContent = (content: string) => {
  content = content.replace(/
```
([\s\S]*?)
```
/g, (_, code) => {
    return "
```
\n" + code.trim().replace(/\s+/g, " ") + "\n
```";
  });
  return content;
};
```

This code uses a regular expression to match all occurrences of code blocks and replaces them with a formatted version of the code. The `trim()` method is used to remove unnecessary spaces before and after each line, and the `replace()` method with a regular expression is used to replace all occurrences of multiple spaces with a single space.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
