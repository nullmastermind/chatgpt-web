## Features

### Chat with Private Document

The main feature of nullgpt is the ability to chat with a private document. By running the nullgpt-indexer repository on your machine, you can interact with the chatbot using a friendly user interface. The documentation for setting up and running nullgpt-indexer will be available soon.

### Customization Options

nullgpt provides several customization options to enhance your chatbot experience:

- **Custom Temperature**: You can adjust the temperature parameter to control the randomness of the chatbot's responses. Higher values (e.g., 0.8) make the responses more random, while lower values (e.g., 0.2) make them more deterministic.

- **Prompt Template**: You can define a prompt template to guide the chatbot's responses. This allows you to structure the conversation and provide specific instructions to the chatbot.

- **Custom Command**: nullgpt allows you to define custom commands to extend the chatbot's functionality. These commands can be used to perform specific actions or retrieve information from external sources.

- **Auto Optimize Command**: The auto optimize command automatically optimizes the temperature, max tokens, and presence penalty parameters based on user feedback. This helps to improve the chatbot's performance over time.

### Smart UI

The nullgpt user interface is designed to provide a seamless and intuitive user experience. The UI allows you to have natural conversations with the chatbot and provides easy access to customization options and commands.

### Custom Model

nullgpt supports the use of custom models. This means that you can train and deploy your own GPT-3 model for more specialized use cases. With a custom model, you can fine-tune the chatbot's responses and make it more tailored to your specific needs.

### Multiple Tokens Balancing (Round-Robin)

nullgpt employs a round-robin strategy for balancing multiple tokens. This ensures that the chatbot's responses are evenly distributed across multiple users or conversations. By managing token consumption effectively, nullgpt can handle multiple simultaneous interactions without overwhelming the system.
